# backtracking algorithm is problem-solving algorithm that uses brute force approach to find desired output
# brute force approach
    # backtracking
        # all solutions
    # dynamic programming
        # best solution (with space and time optimization)

# 3 types of problems in backtracking
    # decision problem: search for a feasible solution
    # optimization problem: search for the best solution
    # enumeration problem: find all feasible solutions

# 1. backtracking checks with a given node is a valid solution
# 2. discard invalid solutions with one iteration
# 3. enumerate all subtree of node to find valid solution
