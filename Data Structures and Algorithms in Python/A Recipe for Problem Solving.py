# 1. understand the problem
    # 1. can we restate the problem in our own words?
    # 2. what are the inputs that go into a problem?
    # 3. what are the outputs that come out of a problem?
    # 4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? do we have enough info to solve the problem?
    # 5. what should I label the important piece of data that are part of the problem?
# 2. explore examples
    # 1. start with simple examples
    # 2. progress to more complex examples
    # 3. explore examples with empty inputs
    # 4. explore examples with invalid inputs
# 3. break it down
    # 1. write out steps you need to take (pseudocode)
# 4. solve or simplify (while solve == False, simplify, simplify until solvable)
    # 1. find the core difficulty
    # 2. temporarily ignore that difficulty
    # 3. write simplified solution
    # 4. then incorporate that difficulty
# 5. look back refactor
    # 1. can we check the result?
    # 2. can we drive the result differently?
    # 3. can we understand it at a glance?
    # 4. can we use the result or method for another problem?
    # 5. can you improve the performance of your solution?
    # 6. how do other people solve this problem?
