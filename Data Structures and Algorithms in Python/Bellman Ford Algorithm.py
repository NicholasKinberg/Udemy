# Imagine you have a map with different cities connected by roads, each road having a certain distance. 
# The Bellman–Ford algorithm is like a guide that helps you find the shortest path from one city to all other cities, even if some roads have negative lengths. 
# It’s like a GPS for computers, useful for figuring out the quickest way to get from one point to another in a network.
