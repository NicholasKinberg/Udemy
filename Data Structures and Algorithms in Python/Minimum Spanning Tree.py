# minimum spanning tree (MST) is subset of edges of connected, weighted, and undirected graph which:
    # connects all vertices together
    # no cycle
    # minimum total edge

# real life example of needing to connect 5 islands but wanting to minimize cost of building bridges between all 5 islands

# disjoint set is data structure that keeps track of set of elements which are partitioned into number of disjoint and non-overlapping sets and each set has representative which identifies that set
    # make set
        # makeSet(N): used to create initial set
    # union
        # union(x,y): merge 2 given sets
    # find set
        # findSet(x): returns set name in which this element is there
